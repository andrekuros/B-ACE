### `Example_Tianshou_DDPG`

A foundational example demonstrating single-agent reinforcement learning for air combat.

* **Algorithm:** Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* **Frameworks:** Godot, PettingZoo, Tianshou
* **Scenario:** A single learning agent is trained to fight an opponent controlled by a Finite State Machine (FSM).
* **Goal:** Provides a clear, minimal example of the B-ACE and Tianshou integration.

### `Example_Tianshou_Task_Based`

An advanced example showcasing a multi-agent, task-oriented solution using modern neural network architectures.

* **Architecture:** The policy network incorporates a Multi-Head Attention mechanism.
* **Methodology:** Implements a task-based decision process based on the **KTAB framework**.
* **Application:** Tailored for complex Multi-UAV task allocation scenarios.
* **Reference:** The implementation follows the approach detailed in the paper: [Knowledge-based Task Allocation with Transformers for Air Combat](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3561250).
